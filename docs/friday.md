ClojureBridgeDC Agenda for Friday June 16, 2017
==================================================

## Join us at Capital one McLean HQ 6:30pm - 8:30pm

Capital One Headquarters <br/>
1680 Capital one drive <br/>
McLean, VA 22102

We'll welcome you at the door so you can sign-in and customize your

## Installfest

The goal of the Installfest is to ensure all the software you
need for the workshop is installed and ready to go. We do this
separately from the workshop because it can sometimes be tricky.
Don't worry -- we'll have plenty of volunteers who are ready to help!

See the detailed instructions on the [Installfest](setup.md) page.

## Dinner

We will provide Dinner!!!

In addition to getting ready for the workshop this is
a great chance to meet the other students and volunteers.
