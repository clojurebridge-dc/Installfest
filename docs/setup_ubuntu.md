Linux Setup
===========

## Starting a terminal

For these instructions, and for much of the class, you will need to have a terminal, or command line, open. This is a text-based interface to talk to your computer, and you can open it by clicking "Dash Home" and typing `Terminal`. You can also open a terminal at any time by pressing `CTRL-ALT-T`. If you have never used the terminal before, you may want to spend some time [reading up on command-line basics](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/command-line-basics).

Go ahead and open your terminal now. It should look something like this:

![blank terminal](img/ubuntu/blank_terminal.png)

The prompt (where you will type your commands) may look different: it usually shows the computer name and user name, as well as the folder or directory you are currently in.

For the rest of this setup, I will tell you to run commands in your terminal. When I say that, I mean "type the command into the terminal and press the Return key."

## Installing Git and Ruby

The **git** version control system is packaged for your Linux distribution.
On Debian Ubuntu systems you can install it with the following
*(as the superuser)*:

```
root@mylaptop# apt-get update
root@mylaptop# apt-get install git git-core git-man ruby
```

*NOTE: We are installing Ruby because it's needed by the Heroku Command Line Interface*

## Installing Java

On Ubuntu you should be able to install Java with:

```
sudo apt install default-jdk
```
## Installing Leiningen

Leiningen is a tool used on the command line to manage Clojure projects.

Go to the [Leiningen website](http://leiningen.org/). You will see a link to the `lein` script under the "Install" heading. Right-click that link and choose "Save Link As...". Save it in your Downloads directory.

![Leiningen site](img/leiningen_site.png)
![Leiningen site](img/lein_install.png)

After that, run the following commands in your terminal:

```
clojurista@mylaptop$ mkdir ~/bin
clojurista@mylaptop$ cd ~/bin
clojurista@mylaptop$ mv ~/Downloads/lein ./
clojurista@mylaptop$ chmod +x lein
clojurista@mylaptop$ lein version
Leiningen 2.7.1 on Java 1.8.0_112 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM
clojurista@mylaptop$
```

After you run the above commands, run the `lein version` command. It should take a while to run, as it will download some resources it needs the first time. If it completes successfully, you are golden! If not, ask an instructor for help.

## Testing your setup

You have set up Java, Nightcode, Leiningen, and Git on your computer -- all the tools you will need for this course. Before starting, we need to test them out.

Go to your terminal and download a copy of the [clojure-getting-started](https://github.com/heroku/clojure-getting-started) repository:

```
clojurista@mylaptop$ mkdir -p ~/src/github/heroku
clojurista@mylaptop$ git clone https://github.com/heroku/clojure-getting-started.git
clojurista@mylaptop$ cd clojure-getting-started
clojurista@mylaptop$
```

Now you can start the sample application on your laptop using **lein
repl**.  This could take a long time, and will download many other
pieces of code it relies on. You should see lines that start with
`Retrieving ...` on your screen.

Below you see the first two Clojure commands start the application. You can then
visit the application webpage on your laptop at
[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
Then you can shut down the application and `(quit)` with the last
two commmands.

0. `lein repl`
1. `(require 'clojure-getting-started.web)`
2. `(def server (clojure-getting-started.web/-main))`
3. Now you can open the web page at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
![heroku test page](img/ubuntu/nc4.png)
4. `(.stop server)`
5. `(quit)`


```

Bye for now!

Yay! Your first web application works on your laptop!


Now you can push the application to the web via **heroku create**:

```

clojurista@mylaptop$ heroku create

Your browser should open (and take a long time to load), and you should see a website like the following:

![Nightcode](img/ubuntu/nc5.png)

If your browser does not open after running `heroku open`, start a browser and go to the URL displayed after you ran `heroku create`.

Congratulations! That website is running the code you have
uploaded to the Interet!!!
You have made a very simple Clojure app and you are all set up to make more!

You're ready for the workshop!!!

## Try the koans

If you're a track 2 student, try to tackle running the [koans](koans.md).
